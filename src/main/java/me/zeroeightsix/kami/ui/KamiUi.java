 * <p>
 * This is where the code for the new KAMI ClickUI will live.
 * <p>
 * Key points:
 * - New user interface. Ordered my most often toggled modules by default.
 * - Searchbar, sort by relevancy
 * - Icons for modules(?)
 * - Simplisitic and lightweight, don't overdo it.
 * - Use Fiber for storing settings (depending on what settings there are).
